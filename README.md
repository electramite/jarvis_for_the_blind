It is primarily built for those who aren't blind by birth so that they know what different colours look like. And its voice recognition feature helps in automating
some regular tasks like user can ask about the time, search his/her query on Wikipedia and can send email to one or multiple accounts at a time (usually faster than
the manual one).
This device uses a webcam to observe the world around the user (blind and colour blind) and a microphone inside the webcam used to receive voice commands from the user
for speech recognition and make their lives slightly better. 
The device identifies the colours of objects that come in front of it, and when user will press the button then using a speaker the colours are told to the user.
 Using this information, the user can decide which coloured clothes to wear, how their room looks and basically get an intuitive feel of how the world around them is. 


For most people, the lockdown represents a seismic shift in how we operate and interact as a civilization. Nevertheless, for blind people,
 the ramifications of social distancing go far beyond even that. The blind are rendered even more helpless. Simple tasks like even deciding which pills to 
take could become behemoth tasks.If any blind person will be affected due to COVID-19 it is very hard to be quarantined for some time so here its speech recognition
 feature comes into the picture. with the help of this user can inform about his/her health to its family members. 
User will not feel lonely because our speech recognition feature also capable of searching query  on Wikipedia thus making them self-reliant.
NOTE:- This code will run only on raspberry pi because we have used RPi.GPIO module which is not available for windows and mac
